/*
when to use?
=>when the mod is not prime number then we do the chinese remainder theorem 

what does it do?
=>let's say we have a number x. if we mod it with m1 then the remainder is y1 and if we mod it with m2 then the remainder is y2.now i need to find the number x.this is  where we use chinese remainder theorem.

for example->
    x=2 (mod 3)
    x=3 (mod 5)

    now i need to find a number.if i devided it with 3 then remainder is 2 and if i devided it with 5 then the remainder is 3.

first of all we use locus theorem
